This Arduino sketch allows an ESP32 to interface with either the Adafruit SCD30 or Sensirion SCD40/SCD41 CO₂ sensors. It dynamically detects which sensor to use based on user input via Serial Monitor and reads real-time air quality data accordingly.

📦 Features
Supports both SCD30 and SCD40/41 CO₂ sensors.

Serial selection of sensor at runtime.

Modular setup and loop structure for clean integration.

Reads CO₂, temperature, and humidity (depending on sensor support).

Configurable via Serial Monitor at 115200 baud.

🛠️ How It Works
Upon startup:

The code prompts the user via the Serial Monitor:

Type 1 to select the SCD30

Type 0 to select the SCD40/41

Based on the selection:

scd30Setup() or scd4xSetup() is called.

Then in the main loop, scd30Loop() or scd4xLoop() continuously reads data.

🔌 Hardware Required
ESP32

One of the following sensors:

Adafruit SCD30

Sensirion SCD40 or SCD41

I²C wiring (SDA, SCL)

USB connection to your computer for Serial Monitor interaction

🧰 Dependencies
Make sure to install these libraries via the Arduino Library Manager:

Adafruit_SCD30

Wire

🚀 Getting Started
Connect your sensor to the ESP32 via I²C.

Upload the sketch.

Open the Serial Monitor (baud: 115200).

When prompted:

Type 1 for SCD30

Type 0 for SCD40/41

The program will begin reading and printing sensor data.

📁 File Structure

Edit
void setup() {
  // Prompt user to select sensor
  // Initialize based on selection
}

void loop() {
  // Loop the selected sensor’s data readings
}
Functions used:

scd30Setup(), scd30Loop()

scd4xSetup(), scd4xLoop()

Note: Only Adafruit_SCD30 is shown in this snippet. Ensure scd4x setup and loop functions are implemented.

📌 Notes
The sensor selection only happens at boot.

The .DS_Store file should be ignored in .gitignore if you're using macOS.
